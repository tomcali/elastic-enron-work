# start elasticsearch
# begin at the home directory

cd dev
cd elasticsearch-5.2.1
bin/elasticsearch

# minimize the terminal application but keep the process running

# at this point elasticsearch should be ready to work 
# from a web browser using   http://localhost:9200

If elasticsearch has been installed properly, we should see a web browser message such as this:

 {
  "name" : "es-node-1",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "VeiQY7eZTyejQRGiLXoV8g",
  "version" : {

    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.4.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
