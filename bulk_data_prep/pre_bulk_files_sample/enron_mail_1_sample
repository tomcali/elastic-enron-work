{"body": "I've had lots of folks ask for more details on the story I reported Monday\nnight as Denver QB Brian Griese made my \"Downgrade\" list in the \"Upgrades /\nDowngrade\" article.\n\nAccording to John Clayton of ESPN, Griese's shoulder injury is a separation\nof the AC joint in his right clavicle.  He took a pain killing shot and\nfinished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against\nSan Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will\nbe a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.\n\nI've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like\nthis victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.\nGriese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket\nbecause he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an\neye on it for you as this shakes out.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\nFrom the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html\nDENVER -- Brian Griese had a secret. Mike Shanahan knew because he was the\nhead coach. Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of\nhis right shoulder.\nHis teammates didn't know what went on behind closed doors in Monday's\ndramatic 27-24 Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium. All\nhis teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an\nill-advised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter.\nGriese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasn't missed. The\nRaiders had an 11-play, field-goal drive that lasted six minutes. Teammates\nsaw Griese trot back to the field, warm up and miss only five plays. They\ndidn't hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and\nneeded a pain-deadening shot to finish the final three quarters.\n\"This is not a game I wanted to miss, and I was going to do anything\npossible to get in the game and help my team win,\" Griese said. \"I was going\nto do it. It was just the will to play and the will to win, and I wasn't\ngoing to come out.\"\nAn hour after the game, Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran\ntheir huddle had a busted wing. His performance was John Elway-like for\ncourage, but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese\navailable as a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Diego\nChargers.\n\"We won't know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury, but he's\nsuch a competitor,\" Shanahan said. \"He's been like that since he's been\nhere. He wants to play, and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure\nhe doesn't further hurt himself. That's the kind of guy he is.\"\nRod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy. Last\nyear was different. In the preseason, it was supposed to be Bubby Brister's\nteam, but Shanahan named Griese the starter. Veterans didn't feel totally\ncomfortable with him. Griese didn't feel comfortable bossing around a group\nof players who didn't take to him.\n\"Brian's the one to lead us,\" Smith said. \"I think it would have hurt him\nmore just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing\nwith the shoulder the way it was. Whatever he does, he doesn't surprise me.\nHe's the best quarterback in the NFL. I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon\nis. We think Brian is.\"\nGriese told his offensive players that he didn't have too much zip on the\nball. They accepted it as just humility.\n\"I wasn't throwing the ball as well I have been,\" Griese said. \"Some of the\nballs just died. At that point, it was just your will to play, your will to\nwin. I wasn't coming out of the game.\"\nGriese was 22-of-32 for 221 yards with a separated shoulder. He'd throw\npasses and hear, as well as feel, his shoulder popping in and out.\n\"I knew there was something wrong with it, but they assured me that I\ncouldn't do any further damage,\" Griese said. \"It was just whether I could\nhandle the pain.\"\nBeing injured didn't make Griese shy away from contact. Several times he\ntook shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High\nStadium grass. Once, cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the\nblindside. Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high.\n\"Believe it or not, the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I\nheard the crowd, and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that,\"\nGriese said. \"I said to myself, 'Well, somebody must be ready to hit me.' \"\nTalk about homefield advantage. Griese has never had an injury like this. He\nhas played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that\nrequires surgery, but this was much more painful.\nGriese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big\nplay. He had to make just an arm-through pass. It was agonizing. He threw a\nskinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the\nchin.\n\"I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I\ndidn't have any zip on the ball,\" Griese said.\nGriese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different.\n\"We knew it was something that was hurting him, we knew he was banged up,\"\nfullback Howard Griffith said. \"That's how it is when you've got a job to\ndo.\"\nStill, the story told after the game amazed them.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n", "mailbox": "bass-e", "headers": {"X-From": "\"Joe Bryant\" <bryant@cheatsheets.net>", "X-To": "\"Cheatsheets Mailing List\" <cheatsheets@egroups.com>", "From": "bryant@cheatsheets.net", "Date": "Tue, 14 Nov 2000 08:32:00 -0800 (PST)", "To": "cheatsheets@egroups.com", "X-bcc": "", "Subject": "[cheatsheets] Brian Griese Injury", "X-cc": "", "Message-ID": "<8062419.1075854677483.JavaMail.evans@thyme>"}, "subFolder": "notes_inbox"}
