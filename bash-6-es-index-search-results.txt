I have made the \nentries into CAPs for the purchase from APX.  I have inc'd load in ST-WBOM.  \nLoad will need to be dec'd and the energy sold off. You may want to  combine \nit with EES(or buy some mws to make it a whole piece to sell) and use NCPA to \nmove it North.  Or maybe export it at Silverpeak.  The schedule is as \nfollows.  8 mw, HE 1-24 on 04/10 in SP-15.  The price is $150 peak, and $100 \noff peak.  Purchase from Services is #574640, and purchase from APX is \n#574629.  Please make any buy-resales and sales under ST-WBOM. \nPlease call with any questions.\n\nThanks,\nBill\n",
